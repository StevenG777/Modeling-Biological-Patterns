# Modeling-Biological-Patterns

## Descriptions:
The project aimed to model the pattern changes of a species of fish over time in Matlab, utilizing System of Partial Differential Equations (PDE). It included algebraic derivation to foster an understanding of theoretical background, where coding part showcased the implementation of the theorectical equations to real life.

## Project Details:
- Writing: Investigated the purpose and local truncation error of applying semi-implicit numerical method for solving system of PDE
- Writing: Derived the discrete Laplacian operator for this project
- Writing: Reformulated and solved the original system of PDE by applying the semi-implicit numerical schema
- Writing: investigated the stability and convergence of the semi-implicit numerical schema
- Coding: Defined the Discrete Laplacian Operator based on the periodic conditions
- Coding: Defined a solver for linear system including the Laplacian Operator, and used it to approximate an actual function
- Coding: Implemented the reformulated expression to code as solution of the PDE system
- Coding: Utilized the PDE system solution to Gray-Scott Model to model the pattern behavior of fish's skin pigment
- Coding: Visualized the pattern behavior into [Animation]()
